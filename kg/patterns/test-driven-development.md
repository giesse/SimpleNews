# Pattern: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Context

Ensuring code quality, maintainability, and correctness is crucial for the long-term success of the Personalized News Aggregator project. We need a systematic approach to developing features that minimizes bugs and provides confidence in the codebase.

## Problem

How can we develop software components in a way that:
*   Clearly defines the requirements and expected behavior of each unit of code?
*   Provides a safety net for refactoring and future changes?
*   Leads to a well-tested and robust codebase?

## Solution

Adopt **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** as a core development practice, particularly for backend logic and critical frontend components. The TDD workflow is as follows:

1.  **Write a Test (Red):**
    *   Before writing any implementation code, write an automated test case that defines a specific piece of functionality or improvement.
    *   This test should initially fail because the functionality doesn't exist yet (hence "Red").
    *   The test should be specific and focus on a small unit of behavior.

2.  **Write Code to Pass the Test (Green):**
    *   Write the minimum amount of implementation code necessary to make the failing test pass.
    *   The focus at this stage is solely on passing the test, not on perfect code or optimization.

3.  **Refactor (Refactor):**
    *   Once the test is passing, refactor the implementation code to improve its structure, readability, and efficiency without changing its external behavior.
    *   The existing tests provide a safety net, ensuring that refactoring doesn't break the functionality.
    *   Remove any duplication or improve design as needed.

This "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle is repeated for each new piece of functionality.

## Rationale

*   **Clear Requirements:** Writing tests first forces developers to think through the requirements and expected outcomes before coding.
*   **Safety Net:** A comprehensive test suite allows for confident refactoring and modification of code, as tests will quickly identify any regressions.
*   **Better Design:** TDD often leads to more modular and loosely coupled designs because code must be written in a way that is testable.
*   **Living Documentation:** Tests serve as a form of executable documentation, demonstrating how different parts of the system are intended to be used.
*   **Reduced Debugging Time:** Catching bugs early in the development cycle is generally less costly than finding them later.

## Implementation in This Project

*   **Backend (`pytest`):**
    *   Python's `pytest` framework is used for backend testing.
    *   Tests for `crud.py`, `main.py` (API endpoints), `scraping.py`, and `llm_interface.py` follow TDD.
    *   Examples can be seen in `backend/tests/test_main.py` and `backend/tests/test_scraping.py`.
    *   The `TODO.md` (and its counterpart `kg/03_work_backlog.md`) explicitly outlines TDD steps (e.g., "Test: Write a failing test...", "Implement: ...").

*   **Frontend (`Jest` and `React Testing Library`):**
    *   Jest and React Testing Library are used for frontend component and logic testing.
    *   TDD is encouraged for UI components, especially those with complex logic or user interactions.
    *   Examples include testing article display components and user interaction handlers.

## Known Uses / Examples

*   The development of the `Scraping Service` (`SCRAPING_SERVICE_PLAN.md`) explicitly followed TDD for:
    *   Basic HTML scraping functionality.
    *   Duplicate URL checking.
    *   Content extraction with `trafilatura`.
*   The development of API endpoints in `main.py` and CRUD functions in `crud.py` also adhered to this pattern, with tests written before implementation.

## Consequences

*   **Increased Initial Development Time:** Writing tests first can sometimes feel slower initially for a specific feature. However, this is often offset by reduced debugging time and increased maintainability later.
*   **Requires Discipline:** TDD requires discipline from the development team to consistently write tests first and maintain them.
*   **Test Maintenance:** As the codebase evolves, tests must also be maintained and updated. Poorly written or brittle tests can become a maintenance burden.
*   **Not a Silver Bullet:** TDD primarily focuses on unit and integration testing. Other forms of testing (e.g., end-to-end, usability) are still necessary.

By applying TDD, we aim to build a more reliable and maintainable Personalized News Aggregator.
