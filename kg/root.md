# Knowledge Graph Root

This directory (`kg/`) contains the project's knowledge graph. It is a collection of Markdown files designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the project, its architecture, decisions, and processes.

The purpose of this knowledge graph is to:
*   Serve as a single source of truth for project information.
*   Onboard new developers quickly.
*   Provide context for AI assistants working with the codebase.
*   Document key architectural decisions and patterns.

## Navigating the Knowledge Graph

Use the links above to explore different sections. Each section is designed to be self-contained but may link to other relevant documents.

This knowledge graph is a living document and should be updated as the project evolves.
