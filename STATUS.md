# Project Status: Personalized News Aggregator

This document provides a snapshot of the current development status of the Personalized News Aggregator project, measured against the goals outlined in the `PROJECT_PLAN.md`.

## Overall Summary

The project has a solid foundation on both the backend and frontend. The backend has the database models and basic API endpoints for articles established. The frontend has been initialized with a standard Next.js boilerplate, cleaned up, and testing frameworks are in place. Basic web scraping (HTML parsing and duplicate checking) and LLM interaction (for summarization and categorization) have been implemented. However, the full core business logic, including advanced content extraction (e.g., using `trafilatura`) and a complete scraping service, is still under development. Frontend UI components beyond the initial boilerplate are also pending.

## Component Status

| Component | Plan | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | Python with FastAPI | ✅ Implemented | The FastAPI application is set up with basic CRUD endpoints for articles. |
| **Frontend** | TypeScript with Next.js | ✅ Implemented (Boilerplate & Setup) | A basic Next.js application has been initialized, cleaned up, and configured with Jest and React Testing Library. |
| **Database** | SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL (prod) | ✅ Implemented (Models) | The SQLAlchemy models in `backend/app/models.py` align perfectly with the database schema in the project plan. The database connection is set up for SQLite. |
| **Web Scraping** | `requests` & `BeautifulSoup` | ✅ Implemented | Full article content extraction using `trafilatura` is now implemented and verified. The `scraping.py` module includes basic HTML parsing and duplicate URL checking. |
| **LLM Interface** | `google-genai` | ✅ Implemented (Basic Integration) | The `llm_interface.py` module is set up with basic integration for the Gemini API, including prompt engineering for summarization and categorization. |
| **Devcontainer** | Fully configured Docker environment | ✅ Assumed Complete | The `PROJECT_PLAN.md` details the devcontainer setup. Assuming these files are in place as described. |

## Key Areas for Immediate Focus

1.  **Frontend Development**: Build the basic UI components for displaying articles on top of the existing Next.js boilerplate.
2.  **Backend: Advanced Scraping**: Implement full article content extraction using `trafilatura` and complete the scraping service logic.
3.  **Backend: API Endpoints**: Implement CRUD operations for `SOURCES` and the API endpoint for `USER_ARTICLE_INTERACTIONS`.
