# Project Status: Personalized News Aggregator

This document provides a snapshot of the current development status of the Personalized News Aggregator project, measured against the goals outlined in the `PROJECT_PLAN.md`.

## Overall Summary

The project has a solid foundation on both the backend and frontend. The backend has the database models and basic API endpoints established. The frontend has been initialized with a standard Next.js boilerplate. Basic web scraping and LLM interaction (for summarization and categorization) have been implemented, but the full core business logic, including advanced content summarization and a complete scraping service, is still under development.

## Component Status

| Component | Plan | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | Python with FastAPI | ✅ Implemented | The FastAPI application is set up with basic CRUD endpoints for articles. |
| **Frontend** | TypeScript with Next.js | ✅ Implemented (Boilerplate) | A basic Next.js application has been initialized. The default boilerplate is in place. |
| **Database** | SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL (prod) | ✅ Implemented (Models) | The SQLAlchemy models in `backend/app/models.py` align perfectly with the database schema in the project plan. The database connection is set up for SQLite. |
| **Web Scraping** | `requests` & `BeautifulSoup` | ✅ Implemented (Basic HTML Parsing) | The `scraping.py` module includes basic HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup, but the full article fetching and saving logic is a placeholder. |
| **LLM Interface** | `google-generativeai` | ✅ Implemented (Basic Integration) | The `llm_interface.py` module is set up with basic integration for the Gemini API, including prompt engineering for summarization and categorization. |
| **Token Limit Strategy** | Iterative Map-Reduce Summarization | ❌ Not Implemented | The logic for chunking and summarizing large articles has not been implemented. |
| **Devcontainer** | Fully configured Docker environment | ✅ Assumed Complete | The `PROJECT_PLAN.md` details the devcontainer setup. Assuming these files are in place as described. |

## Key Areas for Immediate Focus

1.  **Frontend Development**: Build the basic UI components for displaying articles on top of the existing Next.js boilerplate.
