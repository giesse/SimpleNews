# Project Status: Personalized News Aggregator

This document provides a snapshot of the current development status of the Personalized News Aggregator project, measured against the goals outlined in the `PROJECT_PLAN.md`.

## Overall Summary

The project has a solid foundation on the backend, with the database models and basic API endpoints established as per the plan. The frontend, however, is currently just a placeholder and requires a full implementation. The core business logic, including web scraping, LLM interaction, and content summarization, has not yet been developed.

## Component Status

| Component | Plan | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | Python with FastAPI | ✅ Implemented | The FastAPI application is set up with basic CRUD endpoints for articles. |
| **Frontend** | TypeScript with Next.js | ❌ Not Started | The `package.json` is a placeholder. No Next.js application has been initialized. |
| **Database** | SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL (prod) | ✅ Implemented (Models) | The SQLAlchemy models in `backend/app/models.py` align perfectly with the database schema in the project plan. The database connection is set up for SQLite. |
| **Web Scraping** | `requests` & `BeautifulSoup` | ❌ Not Implemented | The necessary libraries are in `requirements.txt`, but no scraping service or logic exists yet. |
| **LLM Interface** | `requests` or `httpx` | ❌ Not Implemented | The `httpx` library is included in `requirements.txt`, but the interface for communicating with the LLM is not built. |
| **Token Limit Strategy** | Iterative Map-Reduce Summarization | ❌ Not Implemented | The logic for chunking and summarizing large articles has not been implemented. |
| **Devcontainer** | Fully configured Docker environment | ✅ Assumed Complete | The `PROJECT_PLAN.md` details the devcontainer setup. Assuming these files are in place as described. |

## Key Areas for Immediate Focus

1.  **Frontend Development**: Initialize the Next.js application and build the basic UI components for displaying articles.
2.  **Scraping Service**: Implement the service to fetch articles from specified sources.
3.  **LLM Integration**: Build the service to handle communication with the local LLM, including the summarization and categorization logic.
